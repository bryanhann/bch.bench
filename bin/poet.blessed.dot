USAGE="""
USAGE:
    $(poet.dot $0)

RETURNS:
    "."    if the calling script was sourced
    ""     otherwise

TYPICAL USE:
    Suppose script X wants to source or call another
    script depending on whether X itself was sourced
    of called. Script X can do this by invoking
        $(poet.dot $0) path/to/other/script ...

RATIONALE:
    There is no standard way for a script to know whether
    was sourced. Typically if it was sourced then $0 is a
    single word, but this word is system dependant. If it
    starts with a dash, $(dirname $0) may give errors.

BUGS:
    The script will be deemed to have been sourced if the
    number of components in ['/'.split($0)] is less than 2.
